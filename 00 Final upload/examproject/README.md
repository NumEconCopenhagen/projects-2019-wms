This folder contains all relevant files to solve the problems in the final exam in the course: Intorduction to Programming and Numerical Analysis. 
The answers to each of the stated problems can be found in the notebook: exam_2019.ipynb.

The exam project solves three economic problems:

1. Human capital accumulation
2. AS-AD model
3. Exchange economy

The first problem consists of solving a human capital accumulation problem in a two period model where the worker wishes to maximize utility.
The worker can in each period choose to work and earn a wage as well as accumulate human capital or not work an earn unemployment benefits. 
After solving the model we find that for some levels of human capital the worker chooses to work in period one even though the potential wage is lower than the unemployment benefits. This is the case, as she by accumulating human capital in period one can obtain a higher income level in period two and thereby get a higher total utility across the two periods.

The second problem consists of solving an AS-AD model known from macroeconomics. 
First the equilibrium values of output and inflation are calcutated. Next, we see how the economy evoles after experiencing a demand shock. 
Lastly the model is simulated for 1000 periods and different statistics are calculated and evaluated. We attempt to numerically optimize certain parameters to fit the empirical data and we see some short-comings that most likely stem from AS-AD framework.

The third problem consists on solving a exchange economy problem with N consumers and three goods. 
First, the distribution of the budgets shares for each good acress agents is examined and the excess demand function for each good is illustrated.
Next, the Walras equlibrium prices are found (where excess demands are approximately zero) in the model and illstrated.
