#### Created by: Mads-Emil Granzow (KFC147), Waldemar Schuppli (LXV175) and Sofie Juel (GDH466)

This repository contains all the relevant files for the exam in Introduction to Programming and Numerical Analysis. 

A short description of the files and folders:

* [Feedback.txt](/00 Final upload/Feedback.txt): A text file including links to feedback given by each group member during the course.

* [dataproject](/00 Final upload/dataproject): In this first project we examine historical daily price data for stocks in the US in the period 2015-01-02-2019-01-02. The data includes 8.715 stocks and 1.007 observations (days) for each individual stock. A number of descriptive plots as well as interactive plots are created to identify differences in close prices and returns across period, sector and the individual stocks. 

* [modelproject](/00 Final upload/modelproject): This project introduces and solves the classic Cournot model from industrial organization, where firms compete strategically by choosing quantities produced. First, we solve the simple version of the model with only two competing firms numerically and compare the numerical solution to the analytical solution. Lastly, we simulate solutions to the general model using the analytical solutions and show how perfect competition is nested in the Cournot Model.


* [examproject](/00 Final upload/examproject): This project contains all relevant files to solve the problems in the final exam which consisted of solving three economic models. These three models were: A Human capital accumulation model, an AS-AD model and lastly a model describing an exchange economy.
