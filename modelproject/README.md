### Modelproject
##### Created by: Mads-Emil Granzow (KFC147), Waldemar Schuppli (LXV175) and Sofie Juel (GHD466)

This project introduces and solves the classic Cournot model from industrial organization:
- We describe the general theoretical framework
- We solve the simple version of the model numerically
- We compare and contrast to the analytical solution
- Lastly, we extend the model to the general setting and create an interactive solution to see what happens for different parameterizations
