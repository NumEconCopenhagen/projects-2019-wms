### Modelproject
##### Created by: Mads-Emil Granzow (KFC147), Waldemar Schuppli (LXV175) and Sofie Juel (GHD466)

This project introduces and solves the classic Cournot model from industrial organization, where firms compete strategically by choosing quantities produced.

- We describe the general theoretical framework and assumptions in the Classic Cournot model.
- We solve the simple version of the model with only two competing firms numerically by using `scipy.optimize` and `scipy.fsolve`.
- We compare and contrast our numerical solution to the analytical solution
- Lastly, we simulate solutions to the general model


The functions defined are in the `functions` module...
