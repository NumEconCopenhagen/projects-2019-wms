### Dataproject
##### Created by: Mads-Emil Granzow, Waldemar Shuppli and Sofie Juel

This project examines daily close values and returns by all stocks on IEX in the period 2015-01-02 - 2019-01-02. Data is obtained by using an API for IEX to retrieve data on daily close values as well as sector on each of the individual stocks. 

To get an overview of the individual stocks data manipulation is performed and summary statistics are calculated. The data includes 8.715 stocks and 1.007 observations for each individual stock. Further, most stocks represent the sector: 'financial services'.

Next a number of descriptive plots as well as interactive plots are created to identify differences in close prices and returns across period, sector and the individual stocks.
